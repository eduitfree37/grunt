# Grunt

Grunt is a powerful JavaScript task runner designed to streamline the process of building JavaScript projects. It offers developers a flexible and efficient means of organizing and managing projects during the development phase. Frontend developers frequently encounter repetitive tasks such as working with small CSS/JS files, consolidating them for production, and compressing/minifying files. Grunt simplifies these tasks by automating them once configured, saving valuable time and effort. In addition to these functions, Grunt can also handle image optimization and various other project optimization tasks.
